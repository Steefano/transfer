Transfer
####################################
transfer is a Python module providing tools and methods for transfer learning.

**Transfer learning** (TL) is an area of machine learning that studies how to leverage knowledge gained from a
series of one or more source domains to train a model on a target domain. TL is an interesting topic because there are many situations,
in reality, where we have access to a large dataset belonging to a specific domain, and we would like to develop a model to apply
to a different situation.

This is the documentation of the repository `transfer <https://github.com/Steefano/transfer>`_.
